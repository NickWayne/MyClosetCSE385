ABOUT: My Closet is a social media platform for fashion lovers to share their closets with each other. This document outlines the user and developer documentation of the My Closet application.

We are using HTML (website) for our front end, these files are provided within the views folder in this zipfile. With this we use .NET including C# files and xml. All of these items are connected to the database.

------------------

SETUP: Download the database and web application from the My Closet GitHub page. You can do this by running 'git clone https://github.com/NickWayne/MyClosetCSE385' within your computer's command line. Open up the folder in Visual Studio. Navigate to the 'index.html' file and click the "Google Chrome" button. Google Chrome will start up and the My Closet web application will start running.

USING THE SYSTEM: To use our My Closet Social Media Platform, the first thing you need to do is create an account. Although you can still view other usersâ€™ accounts and browse fashion information, to fully utilize our exclusive functions, we recommend signing up. Go to our sign up page and create an account by typing in your personal information and your information will be safely stored in our My Closet Database System. After you create an account, you will have your own closet, where you can add new items to your closet to share your clothes with users or view yourself. When adding new items to your closet, you will go to a new page where you can enter the details about the clothing and attach a photo of it. After you add an item, you will be able to delete it from your account page by clicking the red delete button. You can look through specific clothings that you want from our Home screen. When you select an item, you can see the photo of the item as well as its description and its reviews. You can also rate and comment specific clothings and share your insights.
