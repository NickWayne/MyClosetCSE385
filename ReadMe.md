ABOUT: My Closet is a social media platform for fashion lovers to share their closets with each other. This document outlines the user and developer documentation of the My Closet application.

We are using HTML (website) for our front end, these files are provided within the views folder in this zipfile. With this we use .NET including C# files and xml. All of these items are connected to the database.

------------------

SETUP: In order to run the website, you will need to have Microsoft Visual Studio installed with SQLServer capabilities. Open this folder as a website within visual studio, find the index.html file (within the views folder), and hit run at the top. Once in the application you will be able to create an account, log in, add clothing items, view clothing items, rate clothing items, and delete any item of clothing that you have added.

To get the most up to date version of the code, you will need to pull from

USING THE SYSTEM: To use our My Closet Social Media Platform, the first thing you need to do is create an account. Although you can still view other usersâ€™ accounts and browse fashion information, to fully utilize our exclusive functions, we recommend signing up. Go to our sign up page and create an account by typing in your personal information and your information will be safely stored in our My Closet Database System. After you create an account, you will have your own closet, where you can add new items to your closet to share your clothes with users or view yourself. When adding new items to your closet, you will go to a new page where you can enter the details about the clothing and attach a photo of it. After you add an item, you will be able to delete it from your account page by clicking the red delete button. You can look through specific clothings that you want from our Home screen. When you select an item, you can see the photo of the item as well as its description and its reviews. You can also rate and comment specific clothings and share your insights.
