To use our “My Closet” Social Media Platform, the first thing the you need to do is sign up their 
account. Although you can still view other users’ accounts and browse fashion information, to fully 
utilize our exclusive functions, we recommend signing up. Go to our sign up page create an account 
by typing in your personal information and your information will be safely stored in our My Closet 
Database System. After you created an account, you will have your own closet, where you can add new 
items to your closet to share your clothes with users or view your personal and favorited items. 
When adding new items to your closet, you will go to a new page where you can enter the description 
about the clothing and attach a photo of it. You can browse through our clothes categories and look 
through specific clothings that you want. When you select an item, you can see the photo of the item 
as well as its description and its reviews. You can also rate and comment specific clothings and 
share your insights. If you like the clothing and wish to save it somewhere, you can favorite the 
clothing and it will show up in your closet. 

We are using HTML (website) for our front end, these files are provided within the views folder in 
this zip file. With this we will also be using .NET including C# files and xml. All of these items 
will be connected to the database.

To get the most up to date version of the code, you will need to pull from 
https://github.com/NickWayne/MyClosetCSE385.git

In order to run the website, you will need to have microsoft visual studio installed with SQL
Server capabilities. Open this folder as a website within visual studio, find the index.html file
(within the views folder), and hit run at the top. Once in the application you will be able to 
create an account, log in, add clothing items, view clothing items, rate clothing items, and 
delete any item of clothing that you have added.
